## Trouble in Trork Town (TTT) – Hytale Mod

**Trouble in Trork Town** is an open-source gamemode for **Hytale**, inspired by the classic _Trouble in Terrorist Town_
from Garry’s Mod.

Players are assigned hidden roles each round and must rely on deduction, investigation, and deception to survive.
Innocents attempt to uncover the truth, traitors sow chaos from the shadows, and detectives use special tools to piece
everything together—before it’s too late.

The project was prototyped during Hytale’s first week and is designed to be **modular, configurable, and extensible**,
making it easy for the community to build on top of it.

To set up this mod on a server please follow the guide at: [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md#configuration)

![img.png](docs/images/the_round_has_begun.png)

Rounds are event-driven and divided into clear phases:

1. **Waiting**

    1. Players spawn and explore freely.

    2. Round starts automatically when enough players join.

2. **Playing**

    1. Roles are assigned.

    2. Deaths affect win conditions and karma.

    3. Dead players become spectators.

3. **Aftermath**

    1. Cooldown before the next round.

    2. Ideal for map voting or short downtime.

Win conditions are evaluated dynamically as players die.

### ⚖️ Karma System

A configurable karma system that encourages fair play:

* Team kills reduce karma.
* Correct kills increase karma.
* All karma values are configurable.

Planned automatic punishments:

* Temporary bans when karma drops below a threshold.

### 🪦 Graves & Body Confirmation

* Dead players leave behind**graves**.
* Graves can be inspected to:
    * Confirm death
    * Reveal information about the victim
* Prevents instant role revelation and preserves deduction gameplay.
